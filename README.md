### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I was originally a Mathematics graduate, but am now working as a Software Developer in the UK.  
My experience is primarily in C#, SQL and JavaScript, but I have fiddled around a little with Java and Python.  
I enjoy experimenting with different technologies, and have a number of personal and self-learning projects on the go.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Full Stack .NET Developer.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him.
